# Wild World
=======================================================================

Wild World is a building/farming game. The hero of the game can build a small town that is interactive. Money can then be used to buy upgrades for the hero to build a town. Money is accumulated over time and there will be upgrades for each item. Some upgrades increase gold accumulation.

### Functionality & MVP
=======================================================================

User will be able to
* Open a menu to build and buy upgrades for houses.
* User can drag and drop items on to the page to build.
* User can upgrade items and the hero.
* Animation for the houses and hero.

### Wireframes
=======================================================================

### Architecture and Technologies
=======================================================================

JavaScript will be mainly used for the logic and algorithms. The main part of it will also be Canvas.


### Timeline
=======================================================================

*Day 1*

Setup all necessary files for canvas or React.js and images relevant to the project. Learn how to user Canvas to be able to draw images and load images onto the Canvas. 

*Days 2*

Finish drawing the images on Canvas and make the menus on the left.

*Day 3*

Make a drag and drop menu. Users should be able to drag and drop items on the page and make it how they want. Items can be upgraded to look different.

*Day 4*

Finish implementing the logic. Hero can have upgrades too.


### Future Considerations
=======================================================================

There can be a second part to the game that can involve shooting/fighting. Monsters can be killed to get money and experience to upgrade buildings faster.
