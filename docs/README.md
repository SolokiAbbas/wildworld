### Architecture and Technologies
=======================================================================

JavaScript will be mainly used for the logic and algorithms. The main part of it will also be Canvas.


### Timeline
=======================================================================

*Day 1*

Setup all necessary files for canvas and images relevant to the project. Learn how to user Canvas to be able to draw images and load images onto the Canvas.

*Days 2*

Finish drawing the images on Canvas and make the menus on the left. Make logic for troops that go across the screen.

*Day 3*

Make a drag and drop menu. Users should be able to drag and drop items on the page and make it how they want. Cannons can be upgraded to look different.

*Day 4*

Finish implementing the logic.


### Future Considerations
=======================================================================

There can be a second part to the game can involve more complex weaponry types with different troops, making the game more customizable and more difficult.
